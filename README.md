Automates the checkout process for supreme

This is a really (really) simple automated checkout script for supreme.

If you run this you need to type in your information (it doesn't save the information) and after you've filled it the script starts running. If you get a capchta this needs to be solved manually.

This will open a chrome browser that will start the checkout.
