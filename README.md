Automates the checkout process for supreme

This is a really (REALLY) simple automated checkout script for supreme. It will open a new chrome tab that starts checking out.

If you run this you need to type in your information (it doesn't save the information). After you've filled everything in the script starts running. If you get a capchta this needs to be solved manually.
